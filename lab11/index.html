					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The main challenge of this lab was to create an input in our html alongside a button that would ask
						the user to input their username, and sort their name alphabetically.

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This lab was fairly easy but I did run into a problem that had to do with actually printing out any response after a 
						button click. I thought that I had messed up my html JS loading somehow but it was actually because I forgot
						to write a document printing function when coding the event receiver for the button click. Once I included a 
						document() part, it was fairly easy to get everything working.
                    </p>

			<div id="reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This lab taught me that I cannot always trust the way the assignment gives its example code. In this lab, I had 
						to actually think about my past labs and what was missing from the usual JavaScript syntax. It took me less 
						than an hour, but it taugh me a valuable lesson about the labs.
                    </p>
			</div>

			<div id="results">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I successfully created a button that alphabetically sorted any name that was input and activated by my button.
