					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The main challenge of this lab was to access an API with JSON in our JavaScript files. We had to print out a comic API into our website.

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> This lab was super challenging for me without much coding knowledge other than from lecture. I had to use many resources, includinng the help of friends who knew how to code better than me. I also could not get the comic to print out, but a helpful friend in Discord provided the solution needed. I also had to use some of the code we used for the APODs JSBin we did in lecture.
