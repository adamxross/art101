					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The main challenge of this lab was to create a button on each of our text sections that used JQuery to
						 change the appearance of each text box. This required us to not only write a function that completed our
						 desired actions, but also a button that activated the function on a click().
                    </p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This lab was one of the most problematic I worked on since the start of the class. I could figure out how to 
						make the buttons and getting them to work, but I struggled to complete task  x. The main issue was that it required 
						me to change up my code everywhere, which made it hard for me to remember what everything was doing between my 
						CSS/HTML/JS. When I tried to revert everything back to what I had working before trying task x, something else broke and 
						my buttons stopped working. This lab was frustrating.
                    </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This lab taught me a valuable lesson about coding. While the basic concepts we have been completed have been relatively
						easy to transfer between lab files, this lab asked me to really revamp how my CSS and HTML worked, and I accidentally broke
						my code multiple times. I hope to become more adaptive in future labs. 
                    </p>

			<div id="results">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I successfully created multiple buttons that changed the appearances of my text boxes.
