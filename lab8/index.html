					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The main challenge of this lab was to create an array and an anonymous function that would allow us to
                        print out a response in our console.
                    </p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>After the newer concepts introduced in Lab 7, this lab was particularly easy to follow. I was able to make most 
                        of the code work with little errors on syntax that were easy to fix.
                    </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I enjoyed this assignment's easiness while still teaching me valuable concepts. From this lab I was able to learn the 
                        logic of functions and the need for variables to call said-functions. 
                    </p>
			</div>

			<div class="results">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I successfully created a an anonymous function that used the .map() tool in the console! I also succesfully 
                        completed taskx!
                    </p>
