// Ask the player to choose rock, paper, or scissors (or type 'quit' to end the game)
	//Display user choice 
// Randomly select one of the options for the computer
	// Display computer choice between Rock/Paper/Scissors
		// Paste one of nine possible outcomes
		  // Allow for computer to tie with player
// If the input is not one of the valid options, inform the player and restart the game
// Compare the player’s choice and the computer’s choice:
    // If both are the same, it's a tie
    // If the player beats the computer (rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beats paper), the player wins
        // In all other cases, the computer wins
          // If player wins, add +1 to player counter
          // If computer wins, add +1 to computer counter
// Loop to keep the game running until the player wants to quit
  // If the player types 'quit', exit the loop and end the game
    // After exiting the loop, shut down the game
