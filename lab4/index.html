				<h2>Task 1: Pasta Pseudocode</h2>
					<p> 1. Prepare Mushrooms, Garlic, and Shallot
						<br>
						1.1 Remove any outside shell/skin from garlic and shallot
						<br>
						1.2 Slice one clove in thin slices
						<br>
						1.3 Dice the rest of garlic into small pieces
						<br>
						1.4 Slice mushrooms into small slices
						<br>
						2. Prepare Boiling Water for Pasta
						<br>
						2.1 Fill pot with warm water
						<br>
						2.2 Heavily salt the water
						<br>
						2.3 Place the pot, covered, on high until boiling
						<br>
						3. Prepare Chicken and Mushrooms
						<br>
						3.1 Make any necessary trimmings to chicken
						<br> 
						3.2 Season chicken on both sides with user choice of seasonings
						<br>
						3.3 Season mushroom slices with salt and pepper
						<br>
						3.4 Lightly toss mushrooms to spread seasoning
						<br>
						4. Cook Mushrooms
						<br>
						4.1 Place mushrooms in warm pan on medium heat
						<br>
						4.2 Let mushrooms release water and cook until they have shrunk and become a darker color.
						<br>
						4.3 Place mushrooms in dish to the side
						<br>
						5. Pour Pasta in Boiling Water
						<br>
						6. Cook Chicken
						<br>
						6.1 Throw sliced garlic into oil in a hot pan and let sit until oil is thin
						<br>
						6.2 Place chicken into pan and let sit for 6 minutes
						<br>
						Once chicken starts to show some browning on one side, flip and repeat the process
						<br>
						6.3 Once chicken has been cooked through and has hit a reasonable temp, turn up heat to give chicken a light crust
						<br>
						6.4 Once chicken is fully cooked, place into dish/cutting board and cover with foil
						<br>
						7. Cook Sauce
						<br>
						7.1 In a warm pan place minced garlic and oil
						<br> 
						7.2 When garlic is fragrant, put into pan either user choice of red sauce or a combination of tomato paste and canned stewed tomatoes
						<br>
						7.3 Season red sauce, optionally add in chili flakes
						<br>
						7.4 Add butter, heavy whipping cream, and parmesan until sauce is as creamy as needed.
						<br> 
						8. Dish
						<br>
						8.1 When cooked, strain out user choice of pasta then add to sauce
						<br>
						8.2 Add to sauce mushrooms and chicken, mix into pasta until one dish
						<br>
						8.3 Place onto dish for eating

					<h2>Task 2&3: Rock Paper Scissors Pseudocode</h2>
					<code>
// Start the game with title ‘Rock, Paper, Scissors’
  	// Define the three possible choices: rock, paper, and scissors
    	// Establish Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock, Rock beats Scissors, and Ties.
// Ask the player to choose rock, paper, or scissors (or type 'quit' to end the game)
	//Display user choice 
		// Randomly select one of the options for the computer
	// Display computer choice between Rock/Paper/Scissors
		// Paste one of nine possible outcomes
		  	// Allow for computer to tie with player
// If the input is not one of the valid options, inform the player and restart the game
	// Compare the player’s choice and the computer’s choice:
    	// If both are the same, it's a tie
    	// If the player beats the computer (rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beats paper), the player wins
       	// In all other cases, the computer wins
          	// If player wins, add +1 to player counter
         	// If computer wins, add +1 to computer counter
// Loop to keep the game running until the player wants to quit
  	// If the player types 'quit', exit the loop and end the game
// After exiting the loop, shut down the game

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The main challenge of this lab was to create lines of pseudocode that could help us get into the habit
						of thinking like a coder might. First, we had to pseudocode and everyday task, which forced us to
						think of our usual tasks like how a coder might. Then, we had to pseudocode a simple computer game.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One of the main problems I ran into during this lab was formatting a large amount of text such
						as our pseudocoding text. While I could make it legible and easy to understand, there was still
						a fair amount of text that seemed randomly indented. Additionally I struggled to make the text 
						fit next to eachother in CSS for a cleaner profile. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was fairly easy because I did not need to make much happen on any of the sites
						themselves. I found it easy to convert the way I thought about tasks into the way that coders
						think about coding. I found it super fun to think of a way to build a rock paper scissors game,
						and I tried hard to make the steps be similar to what one would need to code a RPS game.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I successfully was able to pseudocode both an everyday task and a simple computer game.
						I did however find trouble making sure the large list of pseudocode formatted correctly into 
						my lab 4 site.
