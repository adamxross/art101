					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The main challenge of this lab was understanding the navigation of VSCode and our own files.
						We were challenged to write code that linked our labs to our homepage, then we had to learn
						how to link our own screenshots into a lab and caption them.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> This lab was particularly simple for the both of us, because much of the work had already been done for us for us
						or in previous labs. However, one area that was a challenge was learning how to 
						correctly display an image so that it did not layer itself with another image or seperate too far. Then, it was a
						challenge to figure out how to make proper captions underneath them.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This particular lab was quite fun because I was able to use some of the CSS 
						HTML skills I had used in previous labs. I was particularly interested with making
						sure my pictures were aligned correctly despite their different size. I put more effort
						into this assignment than I normally would because I had fun tinkering with CSS.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> I was able to successfully navigate and structure my files in VSCode. Then, I was able to 
						create and further customize a seperate lab 3 site that included new challenges such as images,
						 lists, and captions.
