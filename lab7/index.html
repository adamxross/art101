					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The main challenge of this lab was to write out a function in our new lab7 JS files and further create an interface
                        that sorted a username. By default, the output of our JS file would show the inputted username sorted alphabetically, we
                        were also further challenged to customize our output by adding CSS, ignoring spaces and capital letters, making it sort inco
                         an anagram, and also seperating the function into parameters.
                    </p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This was far and away our hardest challenge yet, and required the most amount of online research from W3 schools
                        in order to fully accomplish everything. While I experienced problems accidentally placing '' or "" where 
                        they did not belong, or used "," instead of "+", the main tasks of this lab was generally simple to figure out.
                        Nearly ALL of the Task X tasks seemed extremely difficult, however. Using W3 schools I was able to figure out that 
                        I could not simply add CSS to the div that contained my JS output. Instead, I had to change up how "document.writeln"
                        worked so that it could incorporate my CSS styling. Instead I referenced my output as "output" in all three of my CSS,
                         HTML, and JavaScript and instead use "textcontent=". I did not figure out how to do the other task X tasks.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment required me to spend much more time and effort on the assignment compared to the past two labs on JavaScript.
                         I think that the lab overall went well, but it is unfortunate that I was unable to figure out how to do many of the other
                         task x tasks. Overall, I think I still did well in completing the rest of the tasks as required.
