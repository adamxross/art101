					<h3>Challenge</h3>
					<p>The main challenge of this lab was to work in JavaScript to produce a list that detailed
					the make, model, age, and status of ownership of our main transportation. I also tried
					to challenge myself by making this lab look as minimalistic as possible to experiment with whitespace.
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h3>Problems</h3>
					<p>The main problem I dealt with during this lab was understadning how boolean syntax worked. I 
						did not really understand how I was supposed to make a boolean equal an outcome of true or false. Additionally,
						I usually struggle with formatting and styling in CSS, and this lab proved to also have those difficulties
					</p>

					<h3>Reflection</h3>
					<p>I put a large amount of effort into making this assignment look the way that I wanted it to, but 
						I did not need to spend much time figuring out the main content of the basic JS setup. It was fun
						to use my own stuff as the reference for the assignment's tasks.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h3>Results</h3>
					<p> I was able to successfully create a file in JavaScript and then properly reference that JS file 
						inside my HTML. Finally, I finished up the lab 5 site by customizing it to my liking in CSS.
