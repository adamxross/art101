			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab we were asked to begin writing HTML and CSS for our webpages. We have had to write up an Index.html file, then customize it through CSS. The main challenges for this assignment were to make a functional HTML site and then link it to our own CSS file.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> One of the main problems we encountered while working on the lab was correctly linking and changing the site through CSS. We each had problems with connecting the CSS to the HTML, and had problems with making the CSS changes appear in the full site. </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Overall, this lab was a great first introduction to connecting the main building blocks of CSS and HTML. We put alot of effort into learning the overall flow, grammar, and feeling of the code. I personally put alot of effort into making sure that the HTML ran the same as the first tutorial one that was in our repository. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> We were both able ot fully customize the HTML and CSS of our websites while working together on problem solving. Now, we each have a functioning site that shows our completed Lab 2.</p>
