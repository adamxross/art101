						<figcaption>This image shows just how strange and lame my old code was. In this version, nothing about the text was remotely discernable and it felt more like an art piece than a text generator.</figcaption>

					<figcaption>Pictured above, the new version of my Lab 10 site acts much smoother and provides much more readability if the example text had any meaning.</figcaption>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The main challenge of this lab was to go back one of our old labs and fix or 'debug' the lab so that it worked better.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> This lab did not have many problems because I was focused on simply making my code more efficient because I had not had very many real problems with my code in Labs.
					</p>
			</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> I successfully made my code from lab 10 much better and thus debugged the site for my 14th lab.
