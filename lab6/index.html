					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The main challenge of this lab was to tackle using objects and arrays in Javascript.
						First we had to list our usual<br> transportation we use most often in an array, then we had to 
						list the characteristics of our main transport in an object.</p>
				</div>
			<div class="problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some problems being able to make a function work within an object. Everytime I tried in VSCode, 
						my variable name would change<br> from blue to yellow, no longer making it a variable. I was able to work around this
						problem by doing a simpler variable to list the age of my bike.</p>

			<div class="reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was just like the last assignment with some different characteristics. Therefore, it did not take
						long for me to figure out how to set up my site and how to print the JavaScript I had made in VSCode.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="results">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I successfully created an object and an array in my JS file and successfully printed it into my site.</p>
