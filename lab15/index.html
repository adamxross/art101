					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The main challenge of this lab was to write a JavaScript code that correctly called from an API to print out data onto our sites. We thus had to use AJAX and then style the outpput on our site.

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> This lab was problematic only because it was hard to find one clear way on how to correctly format and use the code that calls on APIs. Once I was able to find a method that worked, however, it was fairly simple to get it printed into my site.
                    </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I successfully used AJAX and APIs by appending a button that printed out Chuck Norris jokes. The jokes, and the API, however, were pretty unfunny and frankly distasteful. I would have used another API but I did not want to mess with the code or my AJAX method haha.</p>
